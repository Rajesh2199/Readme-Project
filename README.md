 ## Description 
This repository contains source codes for a command line application that generates a custom Readme for developers.This application is built using Javascript, and mainly Node.js.

## Installation
In order to use this application and check its functionality the user will need to clone this repositiory in their local drive. Once the repo is cloned, the user will need to open a terminal or Git bash if windows in directory where this repository is located. User then will type "node index.js' in command line and a series of questions will be asked. Once the user answers all the questions, the application will dynamically generate a Readme file with title "MyReadme".

## Notes
This project gave me the opportunity to learn more about command line and the Node.js itself. I did face a few hurdles while building this project, as all developers do while developing a new projects. In order to make this application run smoothly, I made sure I was familiar with new concepts of writing files (Fs), working with modules(specially the inquirer module), dependencies, and package.json files. Because I was recently introduced to these concpets, I had difficulty in undersanding how all of them work together to make just one Readme file. But after working on this project, I now have a clear and concise understanding of Node.js and its details.


## Credits
I would like to say thank you to my fellow classmates Dilan Li and Wyatt A. Hancock for sharing their work. The Licensing portion and the details of this readme you are reading was inspired from their work.
